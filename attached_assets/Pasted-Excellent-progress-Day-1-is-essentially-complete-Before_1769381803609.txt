Excellent progress. Day 1 is essentially complete. Before I issue Day 2 instructions, I need to verify the codebase is clean.

# Pre-Day 2 Verification Questions

**Engineer, please confirm the following:**

## 1. Clean Slate Check

```bash
# Run these commands and share the output:

# Check for any old Express/Vite remnants
ls -la | grep -E "(vite.config|express|server/)"

# Check package.json for old dependencies
cat package.json | grep -E "(express|vite|wouter|drizzle)"

# Check if old folders exist
ls -la client/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No client folder (good)"
ls -la server/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No server folder (good)"

# Confirm Next.js structure
ls -la src/app/
```

## 2. Current File Structure

Please paste the output of:
```bash
find src -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -50
```

## 3. Environment Variables

Confirm these are set (don't share values, just yes/no):
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - set?
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - set?
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - set? (needed for API routes)
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - set?
- [ ] `SELCOM_API_KEY` - set?
- [ ] `SELCOM_API_SECRET` - set?
- [ ] `SELCOM_VENDOR_ID` - set?

## 4. Supabase Database Status

Did you run the SQL schema I provided in Day 1? Check by running this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

Expected tables:
- `profiles`
- `cvs`
- `payments`
- `generated_pdfs`

## 5. Quick Functionality Test

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test these:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ai/summary -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": true}'

curl http://localhost:5000/api/payment/initiate -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": true}'
```

What responses do you get?

# Once Verified, Day 2 Focus Areas

Based on the progress report, here's the priority order:

## Day 2 (Today): Database + PDF Templates

### Priority 1: Supabase Database Schema
If not already done, run the full schema from Day 1 instructions.

### Priority 2: React-PDF Full Implementation
Build out all 6 templates properly. This is critical for the core product.

### Priority 3: Connect CV Builder to Database
Save CVs to Supabase instead of just localStorage.

---

## Day 3: Auth + Payments

### Priority 1: Supabase Auth Pages
- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/register`
- `/auth/callback`

### Priority 2: Selcom Integration
Real USSD payment initiation and webhook handling.

**Engineer: Answer the 5 verification questions above, then I'll send detailed Day 2 implementation code.**
