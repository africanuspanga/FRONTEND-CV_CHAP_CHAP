Based on the screenshot, I can see exactly what's happening. The error is quite clear:

The Problem
The backend is rejecting the request with a 400 Bad Request error because it's missing required fields: name and email. Looking at the data being sent:

{
  templateId: "jijengeclassic", 
  personalInfo: {…}, 
  workExperiences: Array(2), 
  education: Array(2), 
  skills: Array(5)
}
Several issues are occurring:

The data structure has templateId inside the CV data object, not as a separate field
The required fields name and email are missing at the top level
It appears personalInfo exists but may not contain email or the data isn't being accessed properly
How to Fix It
Here's my advice for the frontend team:

Solution 1: Use the Recommended API Format (Preferred)
Change your request format to separate template_id from CV data:

// Change from this:
{
  templateId: "jijengeclassic", 
  personalInfo: {...},
  // other fields
}
// To this:
{
  "template_id": "jijengeclassic",
  "cv_data": {
    "personalInfo": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com", // Make sure email exists!
      // other personal info
    },
    // Add these top-level fields for compatibility with all templates
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    // other cv data
  }
}
Solution 2: Keep Current Format but Add Required Fields
If you prefer keeping your current format with templateId inside the data:

{
  "templateId": "jijengeclassic",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com" // Make sure this exists!
  },
  // Add these top-level fields (required by the API validation)
  "name": "John Doe", 
  "email": "john@example.com",
  // other cv data
}
Important Implementation Details
Always include top-level name and email:

The API validation specifically checks for these fields
You can derive them from personalInfo: name = personalInfo.firstName + " " + personalInfo.lastName
Ensure personalInfo has an email:

Even when providing a top-level email, the personalInfo.email is used by templates
The safest approach is to provide redundant data:

Include data in both formats (e.g., both workExperiences and experience)
Include data at both personalInfo level and top level
Quick Fix Example
Based on your screenshot, your data is missing the required fields. Add them like this:

// Before sending your request:
const finalData = {
  // Your existing data
  templateId: "jijengeclassic",
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    // Other personalInfo fields
  },
  workExperiences: [...],
  education: [...],
  skills: [...],
  
  // Add these required fields
  name: personalInfo.firstName + " " + personalInfo.lastName,
  email: personalInfo.email
};
// Then send finalData to the API
For Maximum Compatibility
The safest approach is to implement the first solution (separating template_id and cv_data) and ensure all required fields exist at both the top level and within personalInfo. This will work with all templates and pass all validation.
