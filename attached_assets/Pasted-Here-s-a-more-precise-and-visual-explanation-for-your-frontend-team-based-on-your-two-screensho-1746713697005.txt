### 🛠️ Frontend Clarification – Fix CV Preview Layout on Mobile

Hi team,

Thanks for the effort so far — but it's **still not matching the expected behavior**. Please read carefully below and make the right adjustments.

---

### ✅ GOAL:

We want the **CV preview to appear exactly like a full A4 page centered on screen** (like in screenshot #1). Users should:

* See almost the entire CV at once (or just scroll slightly).
* Have a clean white margin around it.
* Feel like they're previewing a printed document.

---

### 🟥 CURRENT ISSUE (screenshot #2):

* The CV is **cut off on the sides** — it's not fully visible.
* It **spills beyond screen width**, especially on multi-column CVs.
* The user **cannot see the CV as a centered whole** — it feels cropped and awkward.

---

### 🔧 REQUIRED FIXES (Step by Step):

**1. Wrap the CV preview in a scrollable container with padding:**

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .cv-preview-wrapper {
    max-height: calc(100vh - 200px);
    overflow-y: auto;
    padding: 12px;
    background-color: #f9f9f9;
  }
}
```

**2. Scale the CV preview down so it fits screen width with white borders:**

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .cv-document {
    transform: scale(0.88);
    transform-origin: top center;
    width: 100%;
    overflow-x: hidden;
  }
}
```

> 🧠 If `transform: scale()` is causing layout shift or blur, use `zoom: 0.88;` as a fallback for modern mobile browsers.

**3. Force horizontal overflow hidden to prevent any side scroll:**

```css
body {
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

**4. Add a media query to override any large desktop widths:**

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .cv-document {
    width: 320px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

**5. Make sure buttons below (like “Download My CV”) are outside the scroll container and `position: sticky` if needed.**

---

### ✅ Expected Result:

* On mobile, users see the **entire CV centered**, slightly scaled down like a digital paper preview.
* No horizontal scrolling.
* Only small vertical scroll if the content is long.
* No clipped columns or misaligned elements.
