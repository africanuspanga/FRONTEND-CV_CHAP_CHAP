Got it! Frontend team, this is your complete directive for implementing the enhanced post-CV upload flow. Your primary goal is to bring the provided screenshots to life, adapting them perfectly to CV Chap Chap's brand colors and maintaining the specified user journey.

**To:** Frontend Development Team
**From:** CTO
**Date:** July 30, 2025
**Feature:** Enhanced "Upload Existing CV" - Personalized Onboarding Flow
**Objective:** Implement the new sequence of personalized onboarding screens (`Nice to meet you!`, `You're off to a great start!`) after a successful CV upload and parsing, followed by the pre-populated multi-step CV creation forms. Replicate the attached screenshots precisely, applying CV Chap Chap's brand colors.

**Backend Status:** The Backend team is actively working on enhancing the parsing to provide the necessary `onboardingInsights` data. You will receive an enriched JSON response from `GET /api/get-parsed-cv-data/:jobId` that contains both the core `cvData` for form pre-population and the new `onboardingInsights` for these screens.

### Frontend Instructions: Enhanced Post-CV Upload Flow

Your core task is to create new UI components and orchestrate the navigation between them, displaying the data provided by the backend.

**Phase 2: Data Consumption & New Screen Implementation**

**1. Refine `GET /api/get-parsed-cv-data/:jobId` Handling**
    * When `GET /api/parsing-status/:jobId` indicates `complete`, make the call to `GET /api/get-parsed-cv-data/:jobId`.
    * **Crucial:** The response from this endpoint will now include the `onboardingInsights` object, in addition to the `cvData`.
        * **Example of expected `onboardingInsights` (Backend will confirm exact structure):**
            ```json
            "onboardingInsights": {
              "currentJobTitle": "Digital Marketing Executive",
              "currentCompany": "LEON Bet",
              "keySkills": ["SEO strategy", "copywriting", "data analytics"],
              "tailoredIndustrySuggestion": "creative copywriting and digital marketing",
              "qualityFeedback": {
                "goodPoints": [
                  "You included all the sections employers look for on a resume.",
                  "You listed 7 skills. Great job! Employers like to see at least 6."
                ],
                "improvementPoints": [
                  "We'll suggest section titles that match the ones employers scan for.",
                  "Revise your experience section using AI writing help.",
                  "AI-enhance your summary to align with best practices."
                ],
                "skillsCount": 7,
                "hasSummary": true
              }
            }
            ```
    * **State Management:** Store *both* the `cvData` (for form pre-population) and the `onboardingInsights` in your global state (Context API).

**2. Implement New Screen: "Nice to meet you!"**
    * **Trigger:** Navigate to this screen immediately after successfully receiving the enriched data from `GET /api/get-parsed-cv-data/:jobId` and updating the state.
    * **Screenshot Reference:** **`Screenshot 2025-07-30 at 11.15.57.png` (or `Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 00.42.08.jpg`)**
    * **UI Design:** Replicate the layout and components as seen in the screenshot.
        * **Illustrations:** Use similar style illustrations. If we don't have exact ones, use a placeholder or generic professional ones that fit our brand aesthetic.
        * **Content Display:** Dynamically inject the `currentJobTitle`, `currentCompany`, `keySkills`, and `tailoredIndustrySuggestion` from `onboardingInsights` into the text. **Ensure bolding for key terms as shown.**
        * **Button:** A primary "Continue" button.
    * **Styling:** Apply CV Chap Chap brand colors instead of the blue/orange in the screenshot.
        * **Primary Button:** `#034694` (CV Chap Chap Blue)
        * **Text/Accent colors:** Use our brand palette (`#4D6FFF`, `#E5EAFF`) for highlights or background elements if appropriate, otherwise our standard black/grey text.
    * **Navigation:** "Continue" button navigates to the "You're off to a great start!" screen.

**3. Implement New Screen: "You're off to a great start!"**
    * **Trigger:** Navigates to this screen from "Nice to meet you!".
    * **Screenshot Reference:** **`Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 00.47.06.jpg`**
    * **UI Design:** Replicate the layout, including:
        * **Illustrations:** Similar trophy and lightbulb icons, or CV Chap Chap equivalents.
        * **"You got it right" section:** Display bullet points from `onboardingInsights.qualityFeedback.goodPoints`. Use green checkmarks.
        * **"How we'll help you improve" section:** Display bullet points from `onboardingInsights.qualityFeedback.improvementPoints`. Use orange star/lightbulb icons.
    * **Styling:** Apply CV Chap Chap brand colors.
        * **Backgrounds for sections:** Use subtle background colors from our brand palette (e.g., `#E5EAFF` or a very light grey).
        * **Icons:** Green checkmark and a suitable orange/yellow for the improvement points.
        * **Primary Button:** `#034694`.
    * **Navigation:** "Continue" button navigates to the "Let's review the basics" screen.

**4. Pre-populate Existing CV Creation Forms**
    * **Trigger:** After navigating from "You're off to a great start!" to the "Let's review the basics" page.
    * **Screenshot Reference:** **`Screenshot 2025-07-30 at 11.17.20.png` (or `Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 00.47.29.png`)**
    * **Content:** Use the `cvData` part of the parsed response to **pre-populate the `React Hook Form` fields** on:
        * **"Let's review the basics" (Personal Information):** First Name, Surname, Post Code, City, Country, Phone, Email.
        * **"Let's review your experience" (Work Experience):** `Screenshot 2025-07-30 at 11.17.40.png` - Ensure work experience entries are pre-filled.
        * **"Here's an overview of your education" (Education):** `Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 00.49.18.jpg` - Ensure education entries are pre-filled.
        * **Subsequent Steps:** Continue pre-populating Skills, Summary, and Additional Details sections using the `cvData`.
    * **Live Preview:** Ensure the live preview on the right side of the screen immediately updates to reflect all the pre-populated data.
    * **UI/UX:** Maintain the green checkmarks for pre-filled valid fields.

**5. Styling Consistency**
    * **Global Colors:** Strictly use our primary (`#034694`), accent (`#4D6FFF`), and light (`#E5EAFF`) brand colors throughout all new components. Avoid using the competitor's specific blue, orange, or purple shades.
    * **Typography:** Maintain our established font families, sizes, and weights for headings and body text.
    * **Spacing & Layout:** Pay close attention to the visual hierarchy, padding, and margins to ensure the new screens feel integrated with the existing CV Chap Chap application.

**6. Navigation and Back Button Logic**
    * Ensure the "Back" buttons on all steps of the CV creation flow (including the new intro screens) navigate correctly to the previous logical step.
    * The main `cv-steps` navigation (sidebar with Header, Experience, Education, etc.) should correctly reflect the user's progress through the pre-populated flow.

### Frontend Checklist for this Phase:

* [ ] Modify polling success handler to consume **enriched** backend response (`cvData` + `onboardingInsights`).
* [ ] Create a new UI component/page for "Nice to meet you!" (`Screenshot 2025-07-30 at 11.15.57.png`).
    * [ ] Dynamically inject `currentJobTitle`, `currentCompany`, `keySkills`, `tailoredIndustrySuggestion` from `onboardingInsights`.
    * [ ] Style with CV Chap Chap brand colors.
* [ ] Create a new UI component/page for "You're off to a great start!" (`Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 00.47.06.jpg`).
    * [ ] Dynamically inject `goodPoints` and `improvementPoints` from `onboardingInsights.qualityFeedback`.
    * [ ] Style with CV Chap Chap brand colors.
* [ ] Ensure `React Hook Form` initialization logic correctly uses `cvData` to pre-populate all subsequent CV creation steps (Personal Info, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Summary, etc.).
* [ ] Verify the Live Preview accurately reflects all imported and pre-populated data instantly.
* [ ] Implement consistent navigation logic for "Continue" and "Back" buttons across all new and existing steps.
* [ ] Perform comprehensive mobile responsiveness testing for all new screens.
* [ ] Perform end-to-end testing with real CV files (once backend is fully deployed with AI).

This is an exciting and visually impactful phase. Your attention to design detail and seamless data integration will make this a truly premium experience for our users.
