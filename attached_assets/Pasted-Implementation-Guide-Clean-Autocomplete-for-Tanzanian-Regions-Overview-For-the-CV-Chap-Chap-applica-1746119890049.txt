Implementation Guide: Clean Autocomplete for Tanzanian Regions
Overview
For the CV Chap Chap application, implement an efficient autocomplete component that displays matching Tanzanian regions only when the user begins typing. This minimizes visual clutter and provides a smooth user experience.

Basic Implementation
1. Region Data Structure
Store the region data in a simple array:

const tanzanianRegions = [
  "Arusha", "Dar es Salaam", "Dodoma", "Geita", "Iringa", 
  "Kagera", "Katavi", "Kigoma", "Kilimanjaro", "Lindi", 
  "Manyara", "Mara", "Mbeya", "Morogoro", "Mtwara", 
  "Mwanza", "Njombe", "Pemba North", "Pemba South", "Pwani", 
  "Rukwa", "Ruvuma", "Shinyanga", "Simiyu", "Singida", 
  "Songwe", "Tabora", "Tanga", "Zanzibar Central/South", 
  "Zanzibar North", "Zanzibar Urban/West"
];
2. Autocomplete Component
Create a reusable component that:

Shows no suggestions initially
Displays matching regions only after typing begins
Filters results based on input text
Allows selecting from matches
Implementation Steps
Start with an empty input field with an appropriate placeholder
Only query the region list when the user types at least 2 characters
Filter regions that include the typed characters (case-insensitive)
Display matching results in a dropdown below the input
Enable keyboard navigation and mouse selection of results
Update the input with the selected region
Key Performance Considerations
Debounce the input to prevent excessive filtering on every keystroke
Limit the number of displayed results (maximum 5-7) for mobile screens
Cache filter results to avoid redundant calculations
Close the suggestion dropdown when clicking elsewhere
Accessibility Requirements
Make the component fully keyboard navigable
Implement proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
Ensure sufficient color contrast for all visual elements
Add clear focus states for keyboard users
Mobile-Specific Enhancements
Increase touch target sizes for the dropdown items
Show fewer suggestions on smaller screens
Position the dropdown to avoid keyboard overlap
Add a clear button to reset the input field
By following these guidelines, you'll create a clean, efficient autocomplete that enhances the user experience while entering location information throughout the CV creation process.
