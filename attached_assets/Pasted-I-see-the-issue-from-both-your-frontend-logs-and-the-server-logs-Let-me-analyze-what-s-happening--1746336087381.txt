I see the issue from both your frontend logs and the server logs. Let me analyze what's happening:

The API connectivity check is successful (273ms response time), but the PDF download is failing.

Looking at the data being sent in your screenshot:

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "title": "Software Engineer"
}
However, the server logs show successful PDF generation with a much more detailed data structure:
CV data size: 1945 bytes, keys: ['name', 'email', 'personalInfo', 'workExperiences', 'education', 'skills', 'languages', 'certifications', 'projects', 'references', 'templateId']
The problem appears to be a data format mismatch. The API endpoint expects a rich CV data structure, but you're sending a simplified object with just 3 fields.

How to fix this:
Use the complete CV data structure that matches what the server expects:

The complete structure includes nested objects for personalInfo, workExperiences, education, etc.
Your frontend is sending just the minimum required fields (name, email) plus title
Check frontend fetch implementation:

Ensure you're setting the correct Content-Type header: 'Content-Type': 'application/json'
Verify you're properly stringifying your JSON data: body: JSON.stringify(data)
Example of proper data structure:

const completeData = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    phone: "+255 123 456 789",
    city: "Dar es Salaam",
    country: "Tanzania",
    professionalTitle: "Software Engineer",
    summary: "Experienced software engineer with 5+ years in web development."
