Absolutely. Here's a **very clear technical + visual brief** you can send your frontend team, plus an idea to **achieve full-page mobile display** that feels like a polished CV viewer.

### 📄 Fix CV Preview Rendering on Mobile – Final Request

Hey team,

The issue is still not fully solved.

### 🎯 Our Goal:

We want the **entire CV (full A4 design)** to be shown as a **scaled-down, single-page preview on mobile screens**, just like a real paper inside a phone.

> ✅ Think of how Google Docs or PDF viewers show the full page in your phone — that’s the experience we want.

---

### 🔍 What’s Wrong Now (from screenshot):

* Only part of the CV is shown (cropped).
* The right-side columns are **cut off** (multicolumn templates broken).
* It feels like you're zoomed-in to the top-left corner — **not seeing the CV as a whole**.

---

### ✅ What We Actually Want:

**1. Shrink the entire CV (including margins and layout) into a smaller scale** that fits within the screen **horizontally**, without horizontal scrolling.

**2. Show white space around it**, like a full document on a table.

**3. Allow smooth vertical scroll if needed — but horizontally everything fits.**

### 💡 How To Achieve It (CSS Approach):

#### 🔹 Wrap the CV in a scaling container:

```html
<div class="cv-wrapper">
  <div class="cv-scale-container">
    <iframe src="/cv-template.html" class="cv-preview" />
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 🔹 Style it (responsive scaling):

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .cv-wrapper {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .cv-scale-container {
    transform: scale(0.65);  /* try 0.6–0.7 for best fit */
    transform-origin: top center;
    width: 100%; /* don’t allow overflow */
  }

  .cv-preview {
    width: 794px;  /* original A4 width in px */
    height: 1123px; /* original A4 height in px */
    border: none;
  }
}
```

> 🔁 *If using components instead of iframe, apply `.cv-preview` styles directly to the main rendered component container.*

---

### ✅ Result:

* CV shows in full, centered, like a **shrunken A4 document**.
* Scroll down to view — but **no horizontal scroll**.
* Works beautifully for **multi-column layouts** (like Lizy Ngowi’s).

---

### 📦 Bonus: Add CV page border (optional)

To make it more realistic:

```css
.cv-preview {
  background: white;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  border-radius: 6px;
}
```

---

### ✅ Summary for Devs:

* Shrink the full CV (not crop it).
* Fit the whole layout inside screen width.
* Center it, scale it, and scroll only vertically.
* Don’t touch the inner CV content styles — just wrap and scale.
