🧠 Analysis: Why PDFs Are Coming Out Blank
1. DOM-Based Rendering Limitations
Your first two methods (html2pdf.js and html2canvas + jsPDF) rely on capturing rendered DOM nodes. The key issues here:
Invisible DOM: Rendering into document.body off-screen can result in elements not being fully rendered (especially in headless or browser-throttled modes).


Tailwind Not Applied: Tailwind is a utility-first framework that compiles classes. Styles applied dynamically via Tailwind might not reflect when components are rendered outside the normal tree.


2. ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup
This skips React lifecycle methods (like useEffect), which might mean some data-dependent rendering isn’t included—especially if you rely on runtime layout or hydration.
3. html2canvas Limitations
Doesn’t support all CSS (e.g., overflow, filter, pseudo-elements).


Works better when rendering to screen than to hidden DOM nodes.


✅ Recommendation: Reliable Server-Side Rendering to PDF
If you want beautiful, styled, pixel-perfect PDFs, here’s the stack I recommend:
🚀 Solution Option 1: Server-Side PDF Rendering with Puppeteer (Recommended)
✅ Why:
Full headless Chromium rendering.


Styles (including Tailwind CSS) are applied perfectly.


React renders like it would in the browser.


🛠️ How:
Install Puppeteer in a Node.js microservice:


npm install puppeteer

Set up an Express endpoint:


app.post('/generate-cv-pdf', async (req, res) => {
  const { html } = req.body;

  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: 'new',
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.setContent(html, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });

  const pdf = await page.pdf({
    format: 'A4',
    printBackground: true,
    margin: { top: '20mm', bottom: '20mm' }
  });

  await browser.close();

  res.contentType("application/pdf");
  res.send(pdf);
});

From React frontend:


Render your chosen CV template to a string using ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup.


POST that string to the endpoint above.


Make sure Tailwind is embedded inline or hosted on CDN.


⚡ Bonus: Preprocessing HTML
If your Tailwind setup is purging unused styles, make sure the HTML passed to Puppeteer includes all class names (consider using @tailwindcss/jit for dev).
✳️ Option 2: Use react-pdf (If server-side not viable)
If you must stick to client-side rendering:
react-pdf renders PDFs from JSX, but you’ll need to rebuild templates using react-pdf primitives (<Text>, <View>, etc.), which means no Tailwind or standard HTML/CSS.


But: It works reliably across devices, and can be pre-compiled.


🔥 Option 3: Hybrid – Screenshot Live CV + Backend Conversion
If the live preview is accurate:
Capture the rendered CV with html2canvas as a base64 image.


Send the base64 image to backend.


Convert image to PDF (Puppeteer, Sharp, or PDFKit).


But this gives you “flat” PDFs (not selectable text).
✅ TL;DR Recommendation
Goal
Best Tool
Notes
Perfect fidelity w/ Tailwind CSS
Puppeteer SSR
Renders true HTML+Tailwind
Client-side only, styled PDF
html2canvas + jsPDF
Fragile with Tailwind
Long-term maintainability
react-pdf
Rebuild templates with PDF primitives


🧩 Your Next Step:
Implement a small Puppeteer microservice


Render your CV template to HTML using ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup


POST it to Puppeteer, return PDF blob


Download on frontend using Blob URL
