Admin Dashboard Data Integration - Questions for Frontend Team
Current Issue
The admin dashboard is showing data (127 users, TSH 1,250,000 revenue) that doesn't match the actual database records (2 users, 0 revenue).

Critical Questions
1. Data Source Connection
Q1: Is the frontend dashboard calling our /api/admin/stats endpoint?
Q2: If not, what data source is currently being used for the dashboard?
Q3: Are you using mock/demo data for development? If so, where is it defined?
2. API Integration Status
Q4: Have you tested the admin API endpoints with the correct authentication?
Q5: Are there any CORS or authentication errors when calling the backend API?
Q6: Can you show us the network requests being made by the dashboard?
3. Database Environment
Q7: Is the frontend connecting to the same database as the backend?
Q8: Are you using a different environment (staging vs production) for the frontend?
Q9: Is there a separate database for testing that contains the demo data?
4. Authentication Flow
Q10: Is the admin login working correctly to get a valid JWT token?
Q11: Are admin API calls including the proper Authorization header?
Q12: Are there any token expiration or refresh issues?
Current Backend Status ✅
Working API Endpoints:
POST /api/auth/login - Admin login (email: admin@cvchapchap.com, password: admin123)
GET /api/admin/stats - Real dashboard statistics
GET /api/admin/users - User management
GET /api/admin/payments - Payment tracking
GET /api/admin/templates - Template management
Real Database Data:
Users: 2 total
CVs: 0 total  
Payments: 0 total, 0 revenue
Templates: Available but need CV/payment data for statistics
Action Items for Frontend Team
Immediate Steps:
Test API Connection: Use browser developer tools to verify which endpoints the dashboard calls
Check Authentication: Ensure admin JWT token is being passed correctly
Verify Environment: Confirm frontend and backend are using the same database
Remove Mock Data: Replace any hardcoded/demo data with real API calls
Expected API Call Flow:
// 1. Login to get JWT token
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { "email": "admin@cvchapchap.com", "password": "admin123" }
// 2. Get dashboard stats with token
GET /api/admin/stats
Headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>" }
// 3. Response should show real data (currently 2 users, 0 revenue)
Next Steps
Once frontend team answers these questions, we can:

Fix any API integration issues
Set up proper data flow
Add sample data if needed for testing
Ensure real-time data updates work correctly
